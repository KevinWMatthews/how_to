screen

Screen allows you to run multiple terminals from the same window.

Our control command is Ctrl-t (^T) instead of Ctrl-a (because minicom [?] uses Ctrl-a)

Launch:
	screen

Create a new window:
	"^T" "c"

Toggle between windows:
	"^T" sp
	"^T" "n"

Detach (and return to standard terminal):
	"^T" "d"

Reattach (when you're in a standard terminal):
	screen -r

Exit a single window:
	exit (DUH)

Exit screen:
	"^T" K (k doesn't work)

List all screens:
	"^T" "  (double quote)

Select a window by its number:
	"^T" 0-9

Rename the current screen:
	"^T" A

To scroll, enter copy mode:
	"^T" Esc
	Then up, down, PageUp, PageDown, and so on.
	Tab, Esc to exit copy mode, or
	Hit Esc twice (this method messes up the arrow keys)
