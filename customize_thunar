    Added Alt+t to open a new terminal.
Open /home/username/.config/Thunar/accels.scm
This shows a list of all shortcuts, I think.

Open /home/username/.config/Thunar/uca.xml
This shows all existing custom actions.
The Launch Terminal command has a unique-id of 1446650854989846
Search for this in accels.scm
Remove leading ';'
In the final parenthesis, add the hotkey combination.

Save the file.

Close ALL your work and all Thunar windows!

xfce4-session-logout --logout

You'll log in again and the new hotkey will be active.



To switch between tabs, use Ctrl+Alt+PageUp/PageDown.
Apparently "the underlying GTK control" (GtkNotebook) controls switching tabs; Thunar does not.
